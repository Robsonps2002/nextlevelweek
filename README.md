# Challenge Rocketseat

### This project was a challenge from Rocketseat, which I had the pleasure of working for a week

 
- React native (to mobile)
- ReactJs (to webapp)
- Restfull API (to talk webapp and app with database )
- SqlLite (to building database)

> I have to congratulate @diego3g from Rocketseat. This content was of a very good level and I know that it will take me to the next level of my career.
